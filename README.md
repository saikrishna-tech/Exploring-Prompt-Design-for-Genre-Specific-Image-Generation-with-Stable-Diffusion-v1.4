# Exploring-Prompt-Design-for-Genre-Specific-Image-Generation-with-Stable-Diffusion-v1.4
1. Investigated the impact of prompt engineering on text-to-image generation using Stable Diffusion v1.4.
2. Researched and implemented prompt design techniques, including descriptive language, genre-specific keywords, and targeted keywords for control.
3. Evaluated the effectiveness of these techniques across three distinct artistic themes: science fiction, portraiture, and fantasy.
4. Generated and analyzed a comprehensive dataset of images using over 1000 unique prompts to understand how content, length, nature, keywords, and genre influence image generation outcomes.
5. Concluded that effective prompt design plays a crucial role in achieving genre-specific and high-quality image generation with Stable Diffusion.
